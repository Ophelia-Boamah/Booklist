So I was spending time going through the whole OOP concept to understand it perfectly before I moved on.
But I've found out not to spend too much time on this. Instead, that I should just go through the concept, do the project and finish up the course at least.
That way, I can advance to learning frameworks and then later focus on deepening my understanding on these concepts.

So here I am working on this OOP project.
Basically it's an app that helps to provide info on books. And it displays this info once your fill the fields and press enter
